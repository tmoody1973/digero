# Raw Idea: Voice Cooking Assistant

Add voice-based AI assistant for cooking using Google Gemini Live API. While in cook-mode, users can have a hands-free conversation with an AI that knows the full recipe context. They can ask questions like 'what's the next step?', 'how much butter?', 'can I substitute X for Y?', 'how do I know when it's done?' etc. This solves the problem of not being able to touch your phone while cooking with dirty/wet hands.
