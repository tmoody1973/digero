# Product Mission

## Pitch

Digero is a mobile recipe application that helps home cooks bridge the gap between culinary inspiration and home-cooked meals by providing seamless recipe capture from any source—including physical cookbooks via camera scanning—combined with intelligent meal planning and automated shopping lists.

## The Problem

### The Inspiration-to-Action Gap

Home cooks discover recipes constantly—on YouTube, social media, websites, and in physical cookbooks—but rarely convert that inspiration into actual meals. Recipes get bookmarked and forgotten, ingredients are purchased haphazardly, and meal planning feels overwhelming.

**The reality:**
- 73% of saved recipes are never cooked
- Physical cookbook recipes require manual transcription to use digitally
- Meal planning and grocery shopping are disconnected processes
- No single tool bridges discovery, organization, planning, and shopping

**Our Solution:** A unified mobile experience that captures recipes from anywhere (including physical cookbooks via OCR), organizes them into personal cookbooks, enables drag-and-drop meal planning, and generates smart shopping lists—turning inspiration into dinner.

## Differentiators

### Cookbook Photo Scanning
Unlike recipe apps that only save web links, Digero captures recipes from physical cookbooks using AI-powered OCR. Point your camera at a cookbook page, and the recipe is instantly digitized and organized.
This results in a truly unified recipe library that includes your entire collection—digital and physical.

### Inspiration-to-Table Workflow
Unlike bookmarking tools or standalone meal planners, Digero connects the entire journey: discover, save, plan, shop, cook. One app replaces multiple disconnected tools.
This results in higher recipe completion rates and less food waste.

### Smart Shopping Integration
Unlike basic shopping lists, Digero generates categorized grocery lists from meal plans and integrates with Instacart for seamless delivery or pickup.
This results in faster grocery runs and fewer forgotten ingredients.
